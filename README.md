# BSMRSTU-bus-location
#	Introduction
The students of BSMRSTU often faces the decision of whether it would be quicker to wait for the next bus or to walk or to hire a rickshaw to reach his/her destination.  Many students are often late to work & classes because they decide to wait for the bus instead of just simply using an alternate transportation. We surveyed 30 students about their opinions on the current bus transportation service in BSMRSTU and the following conclusions were extrapolated from the results:
i)	75% of the students asserted that they had been late to their destination because they decided to wait for a bus instead of walking.
ii)	96% of them affirmed that knowing the position of the buses on campus would be beneficial in deciding whether to walk or wait for the bus.
iii)	96% of them also affirmed that knowing the location of the buses is more indicative of wait time than an approximate arrival time.
iv)	The overall approval rate of the current transportation notification service was 38%.


# Objectives
The main objectives for this projects are listed below:
	Maintain and improve the regional transportation system
	Improve the accessibility, connectivity, and mobility of the transportation system
	Improve the safety and security of the regional transportation system for all users.
	Preserve, protect, and enhance the natural and human environment.
	To create an application which is able to estimate and predict the arrival time of public transportation to passengers by taking traffic congestion factor into consideration
	To make more accessible and constantly updated dynamic bus information to bus passengers

# Rapid application development method  
This method is directed by producing high quality system in most efficient time costs. Also it allows to divide project into smaller parts and develop them separately. It’s basic idea to produce high quality system quickly by use of interactive Prototyping. It emphasizes on satisfaction the business requirements. It sets strict deadlines and if project slips the schedule, the emphasis is set to reducing requirements and not on changing deadlines. The prototypes are giving to the user for evaluation.  (CMS 2008) 
# System testing 
System testing in this thesis work will be represented by Specification-based testing. Testing efforts to rich certain level of perfection by detecting all the faults which are in implementation The best way to perform any testing is to select test case that satisfy certain criteria. These criteria are depending on the nature of application and the scope.  (Laycock, 1993) 



# Experimental Overview 

# Advanced Vehicle Tracking System on Google Earth Using GPS and GSM: In this project GPS based vehicle tracking/navigation system is implemented. This is done by fetching the information of the vehicle like location, distance, etc. by using GPS and GSM. The information can be transformed with the following features such as the information of the vehicle like location, etc. is obtained after every specified time interval defined by the user. Then this periodic information of location is transmitted to monitoring or tracking server. This transmitted information is displayed on the display unit by using the google earth to display vehicle location in the electronic google maps.  


# Vehicle tracking and accident warning System using GPS: In this project also the location of the vehicle is determined by using the Global Positioning System. The information from the GPS receiver is sent in the form of SMS to the user with the help of database. Once this SMS is received from the user, a response type of message is sent to the owner of the vehicle through the firebase database system. 

# GPS based tracking system: This system is helpful for public transport vehicles such as buses and taxis, it provides Tele monitoring and management system for the transportation of the taxis and buses within the city. In this paper the system mentioned consists of an on- board module‖ which is mounted in the vehicle which is to be tracked. This on-board module consists of Global Positioning System, database & receiver. The navigation message which is broadcasted by the GPS position satellite is received and resolved by the GPS receiver of the vehicle terminal. This satellite computes the longitudes and latitudes of vehicle coordinates, then transform it into the short message form by using firebase as a server of the database. 

# Design and development of GPS-Database based Tracking system with google map based Monitoring     
This system uses Global Positioning System (GPS) which is used to receive the coordinates of latitude and longitude form the satellite during the critical information. We all know that tracking system is now-a-days a very important in modern world. This system can be used in the monitoring of soldiers, also in tracking the theft of the vehicle and in many more other applications. This system uses microcontroller, Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). This system uses only one GPS device and GSM enable a two way communication process. GSM modem is provide with a  SIM  card  which  uses  the  same  and  regular communication  process  as  we  are  using  in  regular  phone.   


# Conclusion
The conclusions of this study suggest that knowledge of specific domain improves the results. This Project has been implemented on Android platform. Also, different attributes have been added to the project which will prove to be advantageous to the system. The requirements and specifications have been listed above. This project is implemented using Android studio and the firebase domain. Using the GPS system, the application will automatically display the maps and routes to the different locations and also track the bus location using client-server technology and forward it to the client device. It uses basic measurements of distance between two locations and provides necessary details of each and every route for people to easily pick up buses or any other conveyance possible on the specified route. Specific location details are provided to the user along with bus no. so that the person can identify the bus correctly. It uses remote server as its database. Due to this the records can be easily manipulated on the device itself and the server burden gets reduced
